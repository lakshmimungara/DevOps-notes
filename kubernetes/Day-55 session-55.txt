Day-55 session-55(06/11/2024)
------------------------------
create the cluster 
kubectl get nodes 

Recap 
------
helm charts is a package manager for kubernetes applications 
1. we can use helm charts to templatise manifest files 
2. To manage the applications inside kubernetes

In helm-expense 

kubectl create namespace expense 
-> kubens expense 
-> cd mysql
-> helm install mysql . 
-> cd ../backend/ 
-> helm install backend . 
-> cd ../frontend/
-> helm install frontend . 
-> helm upgrade frontend .
-> check in k9s 
-> check in loadbalancer 
Access the application in chrome 

Now in today's class 
---------------------

RBAC (RollBased access control)
-------------------------------
In every system we have two things, Authentication and Authorization 

for example:
------------
Authorization -> Id card scanning while entering into a company 
Authentication -> like username and password 

-> Authentication is proving you are a part of the system 
-> Authorization is proving you have access to that resource 

Generally we have Nouns and verbds 
-> Here nouns and verbs means resources and actions 
-> Resources(nouns)-> VPC, EC2, EBS, EFS, etc 

Actions --> verbs 
-------
create vpc 
update vpc
get vpc 
delete vpc 
list vpc 

User, group, roles and permissions 

for example: 
------------
we have a Datacenter -> roles and permissions 
--------------------
-> everyone can enter 
-> only admins have server creation
-> users have listing servers access 

expense 
---------
trainee --> read access
senior engineer --> deployment access 
team lead --> namespace admin 
manager  --> cluster admin access

-> In RBAC, we have user, role(resource and actions), rolebinding (bind the user and role)
-> This is all authorization 


-> EKS uses IAM for authentication 

what is EKS --> It is a Platform as a service 

Authentication:
--------------
we need to create user in IAM 
-> Go to IAM 
-> Policies -> create a policy -> search for EKS service -> In the drop down read -> click the check box for DescribeCluster
-> Resources -> specific 
-> Click on add ARNs 
-> specify ARN(s) -> give the region as us-east-1  and resource cluster name as expense -> click on add ARNs
-> click on next 
-> Review and create -> give the policy name as DescribeExpenseEKSCluster
-> click on create policy

-> search for expense in policies which describes the details 

-> create an user (eg., lakshmi)
-> click on attach policies directly -> DescribeExpenseEKSCluster 
-> click on next -> create user 


lakshmi joined our team 
-------------------------
-> expense team will send an email to EKS admin that lakshmi joined our team please provide her read access -> Give her read access to expense namespace

Then what administrators do? 
-> They create IAM user, create a role for lakshmi to describe eks cluster 
-> They create role and rolebinding
-> provide access to lakshmi


create a folder k8-admin 


RBAC -> we have an EKS cluster integrated with AWS IAM, IAM provides authentication and inside EKS we have a role and rolebinding to provide the authorization

let us imagine, they have a one client server for expense team  
-> create an instance -> expense 

-> now take the IP address of expense instance and login into the server 
-> aws configure 
-> aws sts get-caller-identity (we will get the lakshmi as the login user)

kubectl installation -> this should done in the created user
----------------------
make sure you are out of the git 
-> curl -O https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.31.0/2024-09-12/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
-> chmod +x ./kubectl
-> sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
-> kubectl version 

-> aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name expense 
-> ls -la 
-> cd .kube/
-> cat config 
-> kubectl get nodes 


IAM checks whether user have expense EKS cluster access or not 

-> kubectl get pods -> user don't have access to the default namespace
-> kubectl get pods -n expense -> user have access to expense namespace

-> create an user venkatesh 
-> attach policy directly -> DescribeExpenseEKSCluster 
-> click on next 
-> click on create user 

-> create an access key for venkatesh 

In workstaion instance (i.e administartor)

-> kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml 
-> kuebctl apply -f aws-auth.yaml 

And now in expense instance 
-> aws configure (enter ther user venkatesh credentials)
-> aws sts get-caller-identity 
-> aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name expense 
-> kubectl get nodes (they don't have access to default namespace)
-> kubectl get pods -n expense 
-> kubectl get deployments -n expense 
-> kubectl get services -n expense 
-> kubectl api-resources 

-> By using this expense namespace we can get the pvc becoz this is user activity 
-> we cannot get the pv becoz that is admin activity and this is cluster level 

-> role and rolebinding have namespace level access 
-> cluster role and cluster rolebinding are cluster level access

-> kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml 


And in expense instance 
-> kubectl get nodes 
-> kubectl get pv 

when interviewer asks for RBAC 
A) In our project, EKS cluster we map and create an IAM user and we will provide the describecluster access and we have role & rolebinding to give namespace level access and we have the clusterrole & clusterrolebinding to provide the cluster level access and we will use aws config map in kube-system namespace to map the IAM user to EKS 
-> This is all admin activity 

taints and tolerations -> imporatant for interviews
----------------------------------------------------

we have a kube-scheduler -> this is master node component 
-> whenever we type kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml, first it checks for authentication 
that if you have any access to apply. It scans for resources and checks if you have access or not that is decided by the kubernetes. It confirms that if you have access and then it hand over to kube-scheduler 

-> kube-scheduler checks for worker nodes and whichever worker node is free and it allocates tha randome one 

eg:

nodeSelector:
	az: us-east-1b 
	

taint --> paint 

example: 
-> banks and RBI may accept painted notes -> it means they can tolerate (tolerate in the sense excuse)

-> you can taint the node(it means it is polluted). for suppose if you tainted any node, then kube-scheduler will not schedule any pod inside that node 
-> kube-scheduler cannot schedule any pod in that node 
-> GPU based servers are required for expense project 
-> taint these GPU nodes 
-> expense project users should give toleration in their manifest files 
-> tolerations are written by users in expense project 
-> manily taints and tolerations means rejecting that other project related pods  are not allowed to nodes 

-> Taints are opposite -> tehy allow a node to repel a set of pods 
-> Tolerations are applied to pods. Tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule pods with matching taints 
-> Tolerations allow scheduling but don't guarantee scheduling 

1. EKS is integrated with IAm for authentication 
2. aws-auth configmap 

1. make sure IAM user exist and he have cluster describe access 
2. create role and rolebinding 
3. edit aws-auth configmap
